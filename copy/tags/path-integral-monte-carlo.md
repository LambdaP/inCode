Path Integral Monte Carlo
=========================

Series exploring the theory and implementation behind the Feynman Path
Integral Monte Carlo numerical technique.  The series convers many subjects in
both physics and computational techniques, including the Lagrangian
formulation of classical mechanics, basic principles of quantum mechanics, the
Path Integral formatulion of quantum mechanics, the Metropolis-Hastings Monte
Carlo method, dealing with entropy and randomness in a pure language, and
general principles in numerical computation!
