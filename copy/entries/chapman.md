So a bit of some personal news (which you can safely ignore if you're not
interested in my personal life!) --- I'm excited to announce that I have
decided to accept an offer to the Computational and Data Science Doctorate
Program at [Chapman University][chapman] in California.  I came to this
decision after a decently long period of deliberation and thinking things
over, and weighting opportunities at Chapman against my other offers.
However, having just finalized everything this week, I am in my choice of
Chapman as my home for my doctoral studies in the upcoming years.

There are two main aspects to my decision --- why computational science, and
why Chapman?

Why Computational Science?
--------------------------

### From Physics

For the first few years of my journey in higher education, I had always
believed that I belonged in Physics.  Well, all my friends were in Physics and
I didn't really know otherwise.  But even before that, there was so much I had
admired about the beauty of Physics.  The quest for elegance in our
models.  The creation and taming of new mathematics to fit our purposes.
The relentless and ages-long drive to unify everything into a single,
beautiful framework with as few assumptions and axioms as possible, and the
fact that from such simplicity, things weave themselves together to create
such stunning complexity.

It was, in some ways, not too long (and in other ways, not soon enough) before
I realized that I was a little out of place amongst my peers, and (apparently)
a long tradition of physicists.

I had often remarked that I would have just as much joy in figuring out the
"physics" of a made-up universe --- that the joy was in finding the
mathematical models that would describe it and finding out the implications.

Apparently --- and who knew! --- these days, physicists are driven by a desire
to understand our own physical world.

I looked back on all of the physicists of history who I admired --- Gauss,
Gibbs, Metropolis, Heisenberg --- I admired them for their ability to invent
and draw from new mathematics to tackle their very real problems at hand.  The
fact that Gauss is almost just as popular in Mathematics as he is in Physics
is a true testament to his genius.  And while Gibbs is known for
revolutionizing statistical mechanics and thermodynamics as we know it, I was
more fascinated by the intricate maths that he pioneered and *invented*,
*just* to solve the problems at hand.

Maybe, instead of taming the world, I was more fascinated with taming thought?

### Taming Thought

Anyways, over the course of the first half of my final year at my
undergraduate university (when I was already, incidentally, working on my
applications to physics doctoral programs), I talked to more and more people
and received a lot of suggestions on what was for me.  I ended up spending
most of my time in the Applied Maths department of my school, and I eventually
stumbled upon the field of "Computational Science".

Really, it seemed to represent everything that I had been interested in and
was pursuing on my own time, for the past year or two.  It represented
everything that interested me in the "real" lab positions and jobs I took.  In
everything I did, I attempted to ask "how much of this problem can I turn into
a problem in computational science?"

The path sort of all clicked together --- in Physics, I was always a bit more
experienced in computation than my Physics peers.  In Computer Science, I was
always a bit more experienced in maths than my CS peers.  My peers were often
times better grounded than me in their respective fields, but I always
recognized myself as one of the few with that specific and unique
interdisciplinary blend. Surely, there were people like me --- surely I wasn't
alone.  And after finding out about Computational Science, as a field...I
realized that I wasn't.

I knew that I could easily and eagerly spend my entire academic career focused
on pioneering new methods and models and theories of computation and applied
maths.  And I knew that it was really what I had wanted to do all along.

Not only was it what I was apparently passionate about this entire time, I saw
it as a very important field in the coming ages.  With computation and data
science more important than ever in the fields of medicine, engineering,
healthcare, economics, meteorology, defense, artificial intelligence, and in
simply rethinking the way we live life --- I was excited to be able to be a
pioneer in this new field that had the potential to impact so many sectors of
the world.  It was exciting also because it was such a new field that there
was much room for innovation, and people today still are only beginning to
partially realize what was even possible with computational science.  If I can
look back in sixty years at the world around me and see a revolutionized world
and believe that I had a part in it all, I don't think I'd be regretting
anything.

These were big motivations, but most of all, I was motivated in my shift by
just simply following my interests and passions.  The rest is a nice bonus!

In this decision, I sort of was saying goodbye to my first love, Physics.  But
in a way, I really wasn't --- this was the part of Physics that I loved this
entire time, and I am not the first in History to make this choice.  I was
eager to apply all of the intuition and tools and insight that I learned from
studying Physics and finishing a B.S. on it to this field that needed --- more
than any other --- someone who came from exactly that background.  I found my
fit!

Why Chapman?
------------

After doing the above soul-searching, it came time to finally send out my
applications.  I collected the best of my references and wrote out my best
personal statements and submitted my applications to a very narrow and
selective set of schools, from a variety of programs and fields --- from
Physics to Electrical Engineering to Computational Sciences (drawn from this
[useful SIAM journal list][siam]).  I only picked programs where I felt I
could apply what I mentioned above.  I was even able to manage to get a
much-appreciated recommendation from a distinguished person in the Haskell
community that I admired very much, a professor at University of California,
San Diego.

The months passed and the offers and rejections came.  I did not receive an
offer from my few choices in pure Physics, but I received offers from places
in Electrical Engineering and Computational Science --- Chapman among them.

Every place I received an offer from offered their own unique benefits ---
from the reputation of a big name to strong ties in favorable industries, and
the like.

Probably the first really impactful event in my becoming certain of Chapman
was my meeting with the Chancellor, Daniele Struppa --- a brilliant
mathematician who literally embodied everything about the field that I loved.
A chancellor who still was active in research, he showed me how he himself
worked in the fields of biology, seismology, geology, meteorology, and
ontology, and many more by simply looking at the problems and linking concepts
of applied mathematics.  With knowledge of the wider context of applied maths,
he was able to look into problems and find just the tool that was missing.

He shared with me his vision of Chapman's future in the sciences, and much of
it reflected his own philosophy.  He dreamed of expanding Chapman as an
established name into industries and fields I was excited to be a part of. And
I saw myself able to not only be a part of a growing field but to also be a
part of a new movement and a very grand vision of an up-and-coming science
university, and maybe even being able to help shape it.

The fact that Chapman was home to an impressive list of top world physicists
(including a 2013 Nobel Laureate involved in discovering the Higgs mechanism)
didn't hurt either!

Still, this wasn't enough to clinch my decision.  Other universities I had
offers from weren't just up-and-coming --- they were already established!

However, when I looked at their doctorate programs (in comparison to
Chapman's), I couldn't help but feel like I'd be compromising myself.  Other
departments had aspects that I could apply what I was passionate about to;
advisers and teams that I could, if I twisted myself just the right way, apply
my interests.  However, everything about Chapman's program seemed to just fit
like a glove.  The objective, the courses, and the projects and advisers, as I
began to realize, were almost as if they were lifted straight from my dream
school --- my dream program!  If I could write my own doctoral program,
environment, and culture, it would almost exactly match the environment,
culture, and program of Chapman.

When I realized that, I realized that I had made my decision.

Onward
------

So...that's it.  I'll probably be using this coming summer to transition into
Chapman and the faculty there, and maybe find a team I could try to contribute
to.  And then I'll be starting in the fall.  I'm excited to see how this
journey winds up in four years, but I know that this is the start of an
exciting next stage of my life!
