So a bit of some personal news --- I'm excited to announce that I have decided
to accept an offer to the Computational and Data Science Doctoral Program at
[Chapman University][chapman] in California.  I came to this decision after a
decently long period of delibration and thinking things over, and weighting
opportunities at Chapman against my other offers.  However, having just
finalized everything this week, I am in my choice of Chapman as my home for my
doctoral studies in the upcoming years.

There are two main aspects to my decision --- why computational science, and
why Chapman?

Why Computational Science?
