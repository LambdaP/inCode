So a bit of some personal news --- I'm excited to announce that I have decided
to accept an offer to the Computational and Data Sciences Doctoral Program at
[Chapman University][chapman] in California.  I came to this decision after a
decently long period of delibration and thinking things over, and weighting
opportunities at Chapman against my other offers.  However, having just
finalized everything this week, I am in my choice of Chapman as my home for my
doctoral studies.
