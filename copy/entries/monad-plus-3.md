Today we're going to learn to solve classic and ageless logic problems without
any data structures besides List's monadic properties!

If you aren't familiar with MonadPlus/Alternative, or Haskell in general,
check out [Part 1][] and [Part 2][] --- it provides all of the background
necessary for any new, beginning or intermediate Haskeller to understand this,
including all essential Haskell syntax :)
