#### on State

Before we move on, let's take a slight diversion --- you can skip this whole
section if you wish, to get onto the main point.

Notice that in our last example, our "state" `n` was the same type as our
"output" `n+1`.  Is this in general the case?

The type of our stream is `Stream Int`...does `Int` refer to the state or the
output?

As it turns out, this `Int` refers to the output --- it is the type of the
"head" of the stream, and all values we will eventually grab from it.

Note however that the type of the state is not actually included in the type
signature, so it can be whatever you want!  As a trivial example, let's say
that `streamFrom` actually takes a `x :: Double` instead of an `n :: Int`, and
rounds it before it pops it out as the "head":

~~~haskell
myStream' :: Stream Int
myStream' = streamFrom' 1.0
  where
    streamFrom' :: Double -> Stream Int
    streamFrom' x = SCons ( round x, streamFrom' (x+1) )
~~~

This function now sorta behaves similarly to our original `streamFrom`...
`myStream'` would still be `Stream Int` and output ints, and we might not ever
be able to tell that the internal state of `myStream'` was "actually" a
double!

Now also observe that the internal state is actually in general *inaccessible*
and *opaque* to the outside world.  What if we had `streamFrom` simply return
whether or not `n` was even?

~~~haskell
myBoolStream :: Stream Bool
myBoolStream = boolStreamFrom 1
  where
    boolStreamFrom :: Int -> Stream Bool
    boolStreamFrom n = SCons ( even n, boolStreamFrom (n+1) )
~~~

~~~haskell
λ: take 5 $ streamToList myBoolStream
[False,True,False,True,False]
~~~

`myBoolStream` simply cycles between `False` and `True`.  Yet, it has an
internal state that is completely closed off to us that is an `Int` counting
from `1` to infinity.  We might not have ever even known.

This property --- that the states of these types of machines are hidden from
the world --- is actually going to be very useful.  Like I said before, every
machine can really be considered self-contained.  This is unlike using a State
monad-based loop, where all internal state is more or less freely viewable
manipulatable by anyone.  Here, every machine is truly its own little world.

In fact, because the type of the state is unknown and unpredictable...even if
we could "force" the state out of a stream somehow, we wouldn't even be able
to work with it in a type safe way.  The type is truly dynamic and the type of
the nth state of a stream is unknowable at compile time.

Here is a stream whose state switches from an `Int` to a `Bool` dynamically.

~~~
wackyStateStream :: Stream (Maybe Int)
wackyStateStream = wackyStateBool True
  where
    wackyStateBool :: Bool -> Stream (Maybe Int)
    wakcyStateBool False  = SCons (Nothing , wackyStateBool True)
    wackyStateBool True   = SCons (Just 100, wackyStateInt 8)

    wackyStateInt :: Int -> Stream (Maybe Int)
    wackyStateInt n
        | n `mod` 7 == 0  = SCons (Just n, wackyStateBool True)
        | otherwise       = SCons (Just (n+2), wackyStateInt (n+3))
~~~

λ: take 7 $ streamToList wackyStateStream
[Nothing, Just 100, Just 8, Just 11, Just 16, Nothing, Just 100]

------------------------

Here is an Auto that outputs a rolling average of the values it accumulates,
with a given window size.

~~~haskell
rollingAverage :: forall a. Fractional a
    => Int          -- length of the window
    -> Auto a a     -- an Auto taking an `a` and returning an average `a`
rollingAverage window = roll []
  where
    roll :: [a] -> Auto a a
    roll xs = ACons $ \val ->
      let xs' = take window $ val:xs  -- pop on the new value, drop all
                                      --   values past the window
          ave = sum xs' / genericLength xs'  -- the average
      in  ( ave, roll xs' )
~~~

~~~haskell
λ: testAuto_ (rollingAverage 4) [2,8,4,5,1,8,3,5,1,1,8,3,5,9,2]
[2.0 ,5.0 ,4.67,4.75,4.5
,4.5 ,4.25,4.25,4.25,2.5
,3.75,3.25,4.25,6.25,4.75]
~~~

Here is an Auto that is always `False`...except whenever it receives a signal
matching a given predicate (if it is "triggered"), it remains `True` for a
specified amount of time.

~~~haskell
onFor :: forall a.
     (a -> Bool)  -- test to see if an input 'triggers'
  -> Int          -- amount of time to stay True for
  -> Auto a Bool  -- An Auto that takes an `a` and returns a `Bool`
onFor p hold = wait
  where
    wait :: Auto a Bool                 -- the "waiting" state
    wait = ACons $ \input ->
      if p input                        -- if triggered,
        then (True, countdown (hold-1)) -- jump to "countdown" state
        else (False, wait)              -- otherwise, stay waiting

    countdown :: Int -> Auto a Bool     -- the "countdown" state
    countdown n = ACons $ \input ->
      if p input                        -- if re-triggered
        then (True, countdown (hold-1)) -- countdown all over again
        else
          if n == 1
            then (False, wait)          -- If counted down, go wait again
            else (True, countdown (n-1))  -- otherwise, count down.
~~~

~~~haskell
λ: :t onFor even 3
onFor even 3 :: Auto Int Bool
λ: testAuto_ (onFor even 3) [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,4,1,6,1,1,1,1]
[ False, False, True , True,True
, False, True , True , True,True
, True , False, False ]
~~~

Here is an auto that keeps a Map as its state, and takes as input a data type
`data Command k v = Insert k v | Lookup k | Delete k` allows you to either
insert, lookup, or delete an item.  However, the map has a "maximum size".  If
you insert past the maximum size, the insert will fail and you'll receive a
`Nothing`.  Otherwise, you'll receive a `Just val` with the value you just
inserted.  Successful lookups will return `Just val`, or `Nothing` on a
failure.  Same for deletions.

~~~haskell
import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map

data Command k v = Insert k v | Lookup k | Delete k

autoMap :: forall k v. Ord k
    => Int              -- the maximum capacity of the map
    -> Auto (Command k v) (Maybe v)
autoMap cap = go Map.empty
  where
    go :: Map.Map k v -> Auto (Command k v) (Maybe v)
    go m = ACons $ \command ->
      case command of
        Insert key val ->
          if Map.size m >= cap && key `Map.notMember` m
            then
              ( Nothing, go m )                 -- Map is full, no go!
            else
              let m' = Map.insert key val m     -- go for it!
              in  ( Just val, go m' )
        Lookup key ->
          ( key `Map.lookup` m, go m )
        Delete key ->
          let result  = key `Map.lookup` m
              m'      = key `Map.delete` m
          in  ( result, go m' )
~~~

~~~haskell
λ: testAuto_ (autoMap 3)
  |  [ Insert "hello" 7
  |  , Insert "world" 10
  |  , Insert "foo" 12
  |  , Insert "bar" 15
