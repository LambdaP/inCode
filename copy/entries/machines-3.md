Hi!  I have to apologize a bit for the long delay; [starting grad
school][chapman] and things like that have made me have to scramble to adjust
to the new life.  But a couple of people have asked me to finish up and wrap
up this series, and I think I owe it to them :)

In the [last post][part2], we looked deeper into the Auto type, played
around with instancing it as familiar typeclasses, saw it as a member of the
powerful *Category* and *Arrow* typeclasses, and took advantage of this by
composing Autos both manually and using proc/do notation, and were freed from
the murk and mire of explicit recursion.  We observed the special nature of
this composition, and saw some neat properties, like local statefulness.

Here we are going to push the abstraction further to see where it will go by
introducing mechanisms for adding effects, making the plain ol' Auto type into
something rich and featureful. And finally, at the very end, we'll do a short
case study on one motivating example: arrowized FRP libraries!

Effectful Stepping
------------------

Recall our original definition of `Auto a b` as a newtype wrapper over a
function:

~~~haskell
a -> (b, Auto a b)
~~~

This can be read as saying, "feed the `Auto` an `a`, and (purely) get a
resulting `b`, and a 'next stepper'" --- the `b` is the result, and the `Auto
a b` contains the information on how to proceed from then on.

Well, if you've been doing Haskell for any decent amount of time, you can
probably guess what's going to happen next.  It's, incidentally, one of the
things that Haskellers love doing the most, and it's been engrained deeply
into the Haskell culture.

Instead of "purely" creating a naked result and a "next step"...we're going to
return it in a context.

~~~haskell
a -> f (b, Auto a b)
~~~

Whaat, you say?  What good does that do?

Well, what does returning things in a context ever lets you do?

In Haskell, contexts like these are usually meant to be able to defer the
process of "getting the value" until the end, after you've built up your
contextual computation.  This process can be complicated, or simple, or
trivial.

For example, a function like:

~~~haskell
a -> b
~~~

means that it simply creates a `b` from an `a`.  But a function like:

~~~haskell
a -> Maybe b
~~~

Means...it *might* give you a `b` from an `a`?  Or it might not?  You won't
really know until you inspect the result later.  If you eventually use
`fromMaybe`, then the resulting `Maybe b` can *control*, using its Nothingness
or its Justness, the final `b` that you get.

A function like:

~~~haskell
a -> State s b
~~~

Means that, given an `a`, you get a state machine that can *create a `b`*
using a stateful process, once given an initial state.  The `b` doesn't
"exist" yet; all you've given is instructions for creating that `b`...and the
`b` that is eventually created will in general depend on whatever initial `s`
you give the state machine.

A function like:

~~~haskell
a -> IO b
~~~

Means that, given an `a`, you're given *a computer program* that, when
executed by a computer, will generate a `b`.  The `b` doesn't "exist" yet;
depending on how the world is and how IO processes interact, how you are
feeling that day...the `b` generated will be different.  The process of IO
execution has the ability to *choose* the `b`.

So how about something like:

~~~haskell
a -> State s (b, Auto a b)
~~~

This means that, given `a`, "running" the `Auto` with an `a` will give you *a
state machine* that gives you, using a stateful process, both the *result* and
the *next step*.  The crazy thing is that now you are given the state machine
*the ability to decide the next `Auto`*, the next "step".


Something like:

~~~haskell
a -> IO (b, Auto a b)
~~~

means that your new `Auto`-running function will give you a result and a "next
step" that is going to be dependent on IO actions.

Let's jump straight to abstracting over this and explore a new type, shall we?

### Monadic Auto

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "newtype AutoM" machines
~~~

We already explained earlier the new power of this type.  Let's see if we can
write our favorite instances with it.  First of all, what would a `Category`
instance even do?

Recall that the previous `Category` instance "ticked" each `Auto` one after
the other and gave the final results, and then the "next Auto" was the
compositions of the ticked autos.

In our new type, the "ticking" happens *in a context*.  And we need to tick
twice; and the second one is dependent on the result of the first.  This means
that your context has to be *monadic*, in order to allow you to do this.

So we sequence two "ticks" inside the monadic context, and then return the
result afterwards, with the new composed autos.

The neat thing is that Haskell's built-in syntax for handling monadic
sequencing is nice, so you might be surprised when you write the `Category`
instance:

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "instance Monad m => Category (AutoM m)" machines
~~~

Does it look familiar?

It should!  Remember the logic from the `Auto` Category instance?

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto2.hs "instance Category Auto" machines
~~~

It's basically *identical* and exactly the same :O  The only difference is
that instead of `let`, we have `do`...instead of `=` we have `<-`, and instead
of `in` we have `return`.  :O

The takeaway here is that when you have monadic functions, their sequencing
and application and composition can really be abstracted away to look pretty
much like application and composition of normal values.  And Haskell is one of
the few languages that gives you language features and a culture to be able to
fully realize the symmetry and similarities.

Following this exact same pattern, let's see the other various instances we
wrote in the last article, along with the new monadic instances:


~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto2.hs "instance Functor (Auto r)" "instance Applicative (Auto r)" "instance Arrow Auto" "instance ArrowChoice Auto" machines
~~~

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "instance Monad m => Functor (AutoM m r)" "instance Monad m => Applicative (AutoM m r)" "instance Monad m => Arrow (AutoM m)" "instance Monad m => ArrowChoice (AutoM m)" machines
~~~


Neat, huh?

Instead of having to learn over again the logic of `Functor`, `Applicative`,
`Arrow`, `ArrowPlus`, etc., you can directly use the intution that you gained
from the past part and apply it to here, if you abstract away function
application and composition to application and composition in a context.

Our previous instances then were just a "specialized" version of `AutoM`, one
where we used naked application and composition :)[^compapl]

[^compapl]: I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that, where Haskell
lets you abstract over functions and function composition with `Category`,
Haskell lets you abstract over values and function application with `Monad`,
`Applicative`, and `Functor`.


<div class="note">
**Aside**

If we look closely at the instances we wrote, we might notice that for some of
them, `Monad` is a bit overkill.  For example, for the `Functor` instance,

~~~haskell
instance Functor m => Functor (AutoM m r) where
    fmap f a = AConsM $ (f *** fmap f) . runAutoM a
~~~

is just fine.  We only need `Functor` to make `AutoM m r` a `Functor`.  Kind
of neat, huh?

If you try, how much can we "generalize" our other instances to?  Which ones
can be generalized to `Functor`, which ones `Applicative`...and which ones
can't?
</div>

### Putting it to use

Let's look at some esoteric and contrived applications and some actual
useful ones.

First some utility functions: `autoM`, which upgrades an `Auto a b` to an
`Auto m a b` for any `Monad` m, and `arrM`, which is like `arr`, but instead
of turning an `a -> b` into an `Auto a b`, it turns an `a -> m b` into an
`AutoM m a b`:

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "autoM ::" "arrM ::" machines
~~~

We will need to of course re-write our trusty `testAuto` functions from the
first entry, which is again a direct translation of the original ones:

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "testAutoM ::" "testAutoM_ ::" machines
~~~

First, let's test `arrM` ---

~~~haskell
ghci> :t arrM putStrLn
arrM putStrLn :: AutoM IO String ()
ghci> res <- testAutoM_ (arrM putStrLn) ["hello", "world"]
"hello"
"world"
ghci> res
[(), ()]
~~~

`arrM putStrLn`, like `arr show`, is just an `Auto` with no internal state
that returns `()` for every single input string, except, in the process of
getting the "next Auto", it emits a side-effect --- in our case, printing the
string.

We can sort of abuse this to get an `Auto` with "two input streams": one from
the normal input, and the other from `IO`:

~~~haskell
!!!machines/Auto3.hs "replicateGets ::"
~~~
