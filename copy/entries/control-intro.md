Over this summer my work has been in the realm of control theory.  I've found
that it's not exactly straightforward to explain what control theory actualy
*is* to people who haven't heard about it before.

Control theory can be said to be the theory behind understanding and
controlling dynamical systems --- in practice, it deals with systems that
display somewhat complex and constant change.

Simply put, control theory is the mathematical framework behind making a
complex system respond to your wishes.

What is a little tricky is explaining why there needs to be a whole
mathematical and theoretical discipline around it --- first of all, why it's a
big deal in the first place, and second of all, why it isn't just a trivial
thing.  After all, if you want a car to go, all you have to do is hook a pedal
to the gas.  No math involved. Just simple pieces of metal moving together
(and in modern times, some digital circuitry), right?

As it turns out, things aren't always just as simple as pumping gas into
things, flipping on switches, or turning a dial until it's juuust right.  In
this series of posts I hope to walk you through a simple introduction to this
deep discipline and in the process maybe be able to shed some light onto this
hidden art --- this strange intersection of mathematics, physics, and
engineering.

Why Control Theory?
