In the tradition of "considered harmful" posts, this post's title is
intentionally misleading and designed to incite controversy --- or at least
grab your attention :)  However, the opinion I am about to state is one that I
*hope* is not controversial at all.

I don't mean that this mythical "IO Monad" is something to be avoid.  What I
mean is that the phrase "IO Monad"...it's got to go.  It has its usages, but
99.9% of times it is used, it is used improperly.  So let's go ahead with
stopping this nonsense once and for all, okay?
