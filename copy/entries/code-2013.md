It's a bit overdue, but, inspired by my own admittedly egregious tweet in
participation of the awesome [#code2013][c13] hashtag, here is a review of
2013 in terms of the programming languages I've worked on and a general
wrap-up of the adventures that 2013 had to offer me.  It was quite surely the
most productive/adventerous year of programming of my entire life.

Scientific Computing
--------------------

This year was the year I began to take scientific computing seriously.  I had
already been using **[Mathematica][]** for many years, for some basic modeling
work on analytic and numeric systems.  This year continued my studies;
however, I also enrolled in a two-quarter class at my university on scientific
computing techniques and applications in the context of Computational Physics.

However, this course would be relying heavily on parallel computing techniques
as well as low-level compiled languages like C and Fortran, with simulations
that would have decently long executin times.

### Linux

I quickly realized that I could not do very much with my little Windows
laptop, so I procured for the first time in my life a persistent server.  I
used the lowest tier from [ToggleBox][], a great cloud hosting service that
gave me a year free.  This was my return to unix-based systems after a
break of several years, and in doing this I sort of went crazy again writing
several **[Bash][]** scripts that I am continuing to open-source/publish
today; many of my scripts revolved around the [todo.txt][todo] framework.

I did some work on parsing some of my custom journal entry files and things
like that, and with this I returned to using **[awk][]**, which I had worked
with a few years ago for processing logs.  I rather really liked the language
and it seemed like a very perfectly adapted dsl.  There are many problems that
are solved most easily in awk and I have a lot of respect for the language.

### Vim

Also this year was the year I decided to begin taking vi/[vim][] seriously.
This is because I realized that I would be doing most of my coding through an
ssh connection, so I needed to pick a good terminal editor.  After a lot of
research I settled on vim.  I've been exclusively using vim for some time now
and, while it has a lot of endearing flaws, I am happy with my choice.  With a
toolbelt of plugins and extensions as well as a firm grasp of the vanilla
basics, vim has served me very well.  I have even delved into some of my own
personal plugin development in **[vimscript][]**
