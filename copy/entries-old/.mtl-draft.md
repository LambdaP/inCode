So, where do transformers fit in this picture?  Well...they're not very close
to the main idea.  But, they do fill an interesting role in the context of
these different interfaces, which we will reveal soon :)

MonadIO
-------

The simplest of these is `MonadIO`.  A lot of times, you have a type that can
represent an IO action.

A contrived example is:

~~~haskell
data IOOrPure a = IPure a
                | IIO (IO a)

instance Functor IOOrPure where
    fmap f (IPure x) = IPure (f x)
    fmap f (IIO x)   = IIO   (fmap f x)

instance Applicative IOOrPure where
    pure = IPure
    IPure f <*> IPure x = IPure (f x)
    IIO f   <*> IPure x = IIO   (f <*> pure x)
    IPure f <*> IIO x   = IIO   (pure f <*> x)
    IIO f   <*> IIO x   = IIO   (f <*> x)

instance Monad IOOrPure where
    return = pure
    IPure x >>= f = f x
    IIO   x >>= f = IIO $ do
                        y <- x
                        case f y of
                          IPure z -> return z
                          IIO z   -> z
~~~

`IOOrPure` is a type that can either represent an `IO` action, or the "pure"
value (pure in the sense of `pure` from Applicative).  The `Functor`,
`Applicative`, and `Monad` instances all reflect this. `fmap` over an `IPure`
leaves it as `IPure`; using `(<*>)` on two `IPure`s leave them as `IPure`s,
but if either is `IIO`, then the result is `IIO`.  For the Monad
instance...binding to an `IIO` will always be `IIO`, but binding to an `IPure`
might potentially be either.[^iopuresilly]

[^iopuresilly]: `IOOrPure` might seem a little silly, but it is definitely
useful for a sort of re-ified "static analysis" --- you can can chain together
a bunch of `IOOrPure`s with the Applicative or Monad instances and in the end
"check" if the value requires IO or not before you run it.  There are also
potential performance benefits if you run an `a -> b` (if possible) over an `a
-> IO b`, and this type lets you "retain" the `a -> b` form, if the function
does indeed not need `IO`.

`IOOrPure` is definitely a data type that can represent any arbitrary `IO a`
inside its type.

~~~haskell
iAbsorbIO :: IO a -> IOOrPure a
iAbsorbIO = IIO
~~~

And so, `IOOrPure` is a Monad that can "encode" or "absorb" or "represent" or
"have embedded" any arbitrary IO action.

Here is another one which might be much more useful in the real world:

~~~haskell
data MaybeIO a = MaybeIO { runMaybeIO :: IO (Maybe a) }

instance Functor MaybeIO where
    fmap f (MaybeIO mx) = MaybeIO (fmap f mx)

instance Applicative MaybeIO where
    pure x = return (Just x)
    MaybeIO mf <*> MaybeIO mx = MaybeIO $ liftA2 (<*>) f x

instance Monad MaybeIO where
    return = pure
    mx >>= f = MaybeIO $ do
                   x <- runMaybeIO mx
                   case x of
                       Just x' -> f x'
                       Nothing -> return Nothing
~~~

This basically lets you do things like short-circuiting on IO actions that
might "fail".  You can then apply a `a -> IO (Maybe b)` to an `IO (Maybe a)`
to get an `IO (Maybe b)`, with short-circuiting.  It's all the usefulness of
`Maybe`...but for `IO` actions!  Short circuiting IO!  Wow!

Anyways, it should then make perfect sense that you can really "absorb" or use
any normal `IO a` here.  You can make any `IO a` into an `IO (Maybe a)`...any
`IO` into a "short circuiting" `IO`.  Easy.

~~~haskell
mioAbsorbIO :: IO a -> MaybeIO a
mioAbsobIO iox = MaybeIO (fmap Just iox)

mioAbsorbMaybe :: Maybe a -> MaybeIO a
mioAbsorbMaybe mx = MaybeIO (return mx)
~~~

~~~haskell
main = do
    res <- runMaybeIO askAndDiv
    putStrLn res

askAndDiv :: MaybeIO Int
askAndDiv = do
    x' <- mioAbsorbIO getLine
    x  <- mioAbsorbMaybe (readMaybe x')
    y' <- mioAbsorbIO getLine
    y  <- maoAbsorbMaybe (readMaybe y')
    if y > 0
      then return (x `div` y)
      else maoAbsorbMaybe Nothing
~~~

Now we can interweave IO and short-circuiting...and also, if IO functions that
could fail were given as `IO (Maybe a)`, we could throw those in, too.

Let's look at another.  Instead of "IO actions that can fail and be
short-circuited", how about "IO actions that can access a global immutable
environment?"

~~~haskell
data ReaderIO r a = ReaderIO { runReaderIO :: r -> IO a }

instance Functor (ReaderIO r) where
    fmap f (ReaderIO g) = ReaderIO (fmap f . g)

instance Applicative (ReaderIO r) where
    pure x = ReaderIO (\_ -> return x)
    ReaderIO ff <*> ReaderIO fx = ReaderIO (\r -> ff r <*> fx r)

instance Monad (ReaderIO r) where
    return = pure
    ReaderIO fx >>= f = ReaderIO $ \r -> do
                            y <- fx r
                            runReaderIO (f y) y
~~~

A `ReaderIO r a` is like an `IO a`...except, that `IO a` has "access" to a
global immutable environment of type `r`.  Chaining together such `IO` actions
will give them both access to the same environment.

Because `ReaderIO r a` can really represent any arbitrary `IO a`...and
"more"...then it can really also be able to absorb any `IO a`...that `IO a`
would just happen to be an `IO a` that never takes advantage of the available
environment

~~~haskell
riAbsorbIO :: IO a -> ReaderIO r a
riAbsorbIO iox = ReaderIO (\_ -> iox)
~~~

Let's throw in a utility function to "access the environment":

~~~haskell
riAsk :: ReaderIO r r
riAsk = ReaderIO return
~~~

And we can do some examples:

~~~haskell
main = runReaderIO toLoop 4

theLoop :: ReaderIO Int ()
theLoop = do
    riAbsorbIO $ putStrLn "I'm thinking of a number."
    theGuess <- riAbsorbIO readLn
    theNumber <- riAsk
    if theNumber /= theGuess
      then do
        riAbsorbIO $ putStrLn "definitely not it.  Try again!"
        theLoop
      else
        riAbsorbIO $ putStrLn "good job!"
~~~

It should be clear that there is some sort of common recurring pattern here.
All of these types are their own types in their own right...and they all also
can absorb arbitrary `IO`.  There are some obvious things that this absorbtion
process should obey, in order to be meaningful:

1.
    ~~~haskell
    return x == absorbIO (return x)
    ~~~

    `return` is like a no-op, so `return`ing into your main type should be the
    same as absorbing the no-op in IO.

2.
    ~~~haskell
    absorbIO (do x <- m
                 f x
             )
      ==      do x <- absorbIO m
                 absorbIO (f x)
    ~~~

    This means that "absorb" distributes over binds.  Absorbing a do block or
    chain of binds should be the same as going in and absorbing every
    component individually.

    ~~~haskell
    foo = do
        x <- absorbIO getLine
        absorbIO $ putStrLn ("you entered: " ++ x)
    ~~~

    should be the same as

    ~~~haskell
    foo = absorbIO $ do
            x <- getLine
            putStrLn ("you entered: " ++ x)
    ~~~

Basically, we say that `absorbIO` is a [monad morphism][mmorph].

[mmorph]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmorph-1.0.4/docs/Control-Monad-Morph.html

This general pattern actually pops up a lot.  And we can actually create a
typeclass that will give it all a common name.

This is where *mtl* comes in!  This is where it shines!  This is what it was
made for!  It has a typeclass for us that represents exactly this!

~~~haskell
class Monad m => MonadIO m where
    liftIO :: IO a -> m a
~~~

We require `Monad` because the "laws" that `MonadIO` must satisfy only make
sense in the context of `m` being a `Monad`.  We could "relax" the constraint,
and make it `Applicative` or even *anything*, but then a type being an
instance of `MonadIO` would have less guaruntees under its monadness.

<div class="note">
**Aside**

But why not just have it have no constraints, and stipulate that
the laws only really apply as needed?  After all, the first law can be stated
in terms of Applicative.  And we can say that *if* the type is a Monad, it
must also follow the second law!  (We can also state the second law's
consequences to an Applicative, as well).  Actually, I don't really know the
answer to this.

However, it *does* solve the practical purpose of sparing us from having to
write:

~~~haskell
foo :: (Monad m, MonadIO m) => ...
~~~

every time we provide a `MonadIO` function that also uses `Monad` stuff.

In all honesty, the name `MonadIO` is kind of silly anyways.  But.  A lot of
things in mtl are silly.
</div>

Now, we can write all of the functions above using `liftIO` instead of their
individual *absorb* function.  And also, we can now write functions that can
work for *all* `MonadIO`s!  Hooray!

<div class="note">
**Aside**

It's mostly useful to write functions generic over `MonadIO` when you combine
other constraints:

~~~haskell
foo :: (MonadReader s m, MonadIO m) => ...
~~~

Please don't write any functions like:

~~~haskell
foo :: MonadIO m => ...
~~~

in real life.  Thank you! :D  The world will appreciate you.

Signed, \
the world.[^justwenthere]

[^justwenthere]: Yes, I just went there.  What you gonna do about it?
</div>

MonadReader
-----------

Let's look at a more interesting type of interface over Monads ... monads with
some sort of "environment" in the context of their evaluation.

For example, here is a type that runs a "pure" function, but...when it is
"run", it asks for a string from *stdin* that the function will be provided.

~~~haskell
data WithStdIn a = WithStdIn (String -> a)

runWithStdIn :: WithStdIn a -> IO a
runWithStdIn (WithStdIn w) = fmap w getLine

askStdIn :: WithStdIn String
askStdIn = WithStdIn $ \s -> s

instance Functor WithStdIn where
    fmap f (WithStdIn w) = WithStdIn $ \s -> f (w s)
~~~

The `Functor` instance is defined so that "mapping" `f` is like applying `f`
to the value produced by the resulting `IO` action.

We might want to combine/compose/chain such actions...if we have multiple
`WithStdIn a`'s, we might want to combine them into one big `WithStdIn a`, and
"run it" all at once, with the guaruntee that it only "asks" for input once
from *stdin*.

~~~haskell
instance Applicative WithStdIn where
    pure x = WithStdIn $ \_ -> x
    WithStdIn wf <*> WithStdIn wx = WithStdIn $ \s -> (wf s) (wx s)

instance Monad WithStdIn where
    return = pure
    WithStdIn wx >>= f = WithStdIn $ \s -> let (WithStdIn wy) = f (x s)
                                           in  wy s
~~~

Here, we have defined `(<*>)` and `(>>=)` such that combining `WithStdIn`s
basically provides all of the functions with the same input string.

~~~haskell
ghci> let sayHello :: WithStdIn String
          sayHello = fmap ("hello " ++) askStdIn
ghci> let countLength :: WithStdIn Int
          countLength = fmap length askStdIn
ghci> let doBoth :: WithStdIn (String, Int)
          doBoth = liftA2 (,) sayHello countLength

ghci> runWithStdIn doBoth
"Justin"
-- ==> ("hello Justin", 6)

ghci> runWithStdIn $ liftA2 (,) askStdIn askStdIn
"Hi"
-- ==> ("Hi", "Hi")
~~~

Here, `liftA2` makes a new `WithStdIn`, and runs "both" of the original ones
from the same *stdin* input query.  In this way, we could have guaruntees that
every "chained" item requires only one IO request...even "asking" twice only
yields the original request.

We could make `WithStdIn` a bit more powerful by allowing us to perform
different `IO` actions on the result of querying `stdin`:

~~~haskell
data WithStdInIO a = WithStdInIO (String -> IO a)

runWithStdInIO :: WithStdInIO a -> IO a
runWithStdInIO (WithStdInIO w) = w =<< getLine

askStdInIO :: WithStdInIO String
askStdInIO = WithStdInIO $ \s -> return s

instance Functor WithStdInIO where
    fmap f (WithStdInIO w) = WithStdInIO $ \s -> fmap f (w s)

instance Applicative WithStdInIO where
    pure x = WithStdInIO $ \_ -> return x
    WithStdInIO wf <*> WithStdInIO wx = WithStdInIO $ \s -> wf s <*> wx s

instance Monad WithStdInIO where
    return = pure
    WithStdInIO wx >>= f = WithStdInIO $ \s -> do
                             x <- wx s
                             let (WithStdInIO wy) = f x
                             wy s

instance MonadIO WithStdInIO where
    liftIO iox = WithStdInIO $ \_ -> iox
~~~

Note that it is indeed an instance of `MonadIO`, like we discussed earlier.

~~~haskell
ghci> let countLengthIO :: WithStdInIO Int
          countLengthIO = fmap length askStdIn
ghci> let sayHelloIO :: WithStdInIO ()
          sayHelloIO = do
              s <- askStdInIO
              k1 <- countLengthIO
              liftIO $ do
                  putStrLn ("hello " ++ s)
                  putStrLn ("length " ++ show k1)
              k2 <- countLengthIO
              liftIO $
                  putStrLn ("length is still " ++ show k2)

ghci> runWithStdInIO (sayHelloIO >> sayHelloIO)
"Justin"
-- hello Justin
-- length: 6
-- length is still 6
-- hello Justin
-- length: 6
-- length is still 6
~~~

Note that each call to `countLengthIO` still only relies on a single.query at
the beginning.  And even "doing `sayHelloIO` twice" (the *entire*
`sayHelloIO` command) only asks for the input once; if we had just made
`sayHelloIO` a normal `IO` action, then it would be hard to make two of them
only ask for input once.




<!-- There are many situations where your data types embody some sort of idea of an -->
<!-- "environment" in the context of their evaluation. -->

<!-- The typical example given is for the type `a -> b`. If you write such a -->
<!-- function: -->

<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- foo :: Int -> Bool -->
<!-- foo x = ... -->
<!-- ~~~ -->

<!-- Then, everywhere in your function, you have "access" to that `Int`, `x`.  `x` -->
<!-- is a part of the environment of that function's attempt to provide a `Bool`. -->
<!-- `foo` can be seen as "a `Bool`...where you are given an `Int` to play around -->
<!-- with to make such a `Bool`". -->

<!-- Commonly, this can be extended to functions returning a `Bool` in some sort of -->

<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- fooMayb :: Int -> Maybe Bool -->
<!-- ~~~ -->

<!-- Hm.  This doesn't really seem much more interesting.  Instead of having an -->
<!-- `Int` to produce a `Bool`, you have an `Int` to produce a `Maybe Bool`. -->

<!-- But...some time around the turn of the decade, we discovered that the real -->
<!-- "magic" occurs when you try to "fuse together" two such -->
<!-- "environmenty-functions".  "Sequence", so to speak.  Run them both from the -->

<!-- For example, say you have `foo :: Int -> Bool` and `bar :: Int -> String`.  We -->

<!-- runFork :: (a -> b) -> (a -> c) -> (a -> (b, c)) -->
<!-- runFork f g = \x -> (f x, g x) -->
<!-- ~~~ -->

<!-- That would take both `a -> b`'s and then turn them all into an `a -> (b, -->

<!-- If you are familiar with Haskell, you might recognize this pattern as `liftA2 -->
