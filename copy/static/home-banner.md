[Justin Le][about]
------------------

Welcome!  My name is Justin Le.  I'm a PhD student at Chapman University in
California, studying Computational Science & Applied Maths; I studied Physics
and Computer Science at University of California, San Diego :)

This is just my weblog covering my various adventures in programming and
explorations in the vast worlds of computation, physics, engineering,
mathematics, and knowledge. Expect a healthy curiosity and an only slightly
unhealthy obsession for finding new ways to marvel, wonder, and create.  Join
me if you wish!
