<p>Today, we’re going to dive into the world of types that <em>depend</em> on factors unknown until runtime, and see how dependent types in a strongly typed language like Haskell helps us write safer, more correct, and more maintainable code.

<h2 id="run-time-types">Run-time Types</h2>
<p>Recall the type we had for our neural networks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">ghci<span class="fu">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">:</span>k <span class="dt">Network</span>
<span class="dt">Network</span><span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Nat</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [<span class="dt">Nat</span>] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Nat</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="fu">*</span></code></pre></div>
<p>They’re of the form <code>Network i hs o</code>, where <code>i</code> is the size of the input vector it expects, <code>hs</code> is the list of hidden layer sizes, and <code>o</code> is the size of the output vector it produces. Something of type <code>Network 10 '[6, 4] 3</code> is a network with 10 input nodes, two input layers of size 6 and 4, and 3 output nodes.</p>
<p>This is great and all, but there’s an apparent severe limitation to this: Haskell is a statically typed language, right? So doesn’t this mean that using a network requires that you know the entire structure of the network at compile-time?</p>
<p>It’s conceivable that you might be able to have the input and output sizes known at compile-time, but it’s probably likely that you <em>don’t</em> know the what you want your hidden layer structure to be in advance. You might want to load it from a configuration file, or have it depend on user input. But can a type really depend on things that you can’t know until runtime?</p>
<p>To illustrate more clearly:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> ()
main <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    putStrLn <span class="st">&quot;What hidden layer structure do you want?&quot;</span>
    hs  <span class="ot">&lt;- readLn        ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> [<span class="dt">Integer</span>]
    net <span class="ot">&lt;- randomNetwork ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dv">10</span> <span class="fu">???</span> <span class="dv">3</span>   <span class="co">-- what is ???</span>
    <span class="co">-- ...?</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would <em>want</em> to put <code>hs</code> there where <code>???</code> is, but…<code>???</code> has to be a type (of kind <code>[Nat]</code>). <code>hs</code> is a value (of type <code>[Integer]</code>). It’s clear here that the <em>type</em> of our network depends on something we can’t write down or decide until runtime.</p>
<h3 id="a-story-of-parametricity">A Story of Parametricity</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the type of <code>randomNet</code> again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">randomNet ::</span> m (<span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o)
             <span class="co">-- plus some constraints yadda yadda</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get more insight onto what the type is really saying, let’s see the same signature with the explicit forall’s:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">randomNet ::</span> forall m i hs o<span class="fu">.</span> m (<span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o)
             <span class="co">-- plus some constraints yadda yadda</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In English, this means that <code>randomNet</code> lets you produce a <code>Network i hs o</code> for <em>any</em> <code>i</code> you want, for <em>any</em> <code>hs</code> you want, for <em>any</em> <code>o</code> you want. It’s implemented in a <em>parametrically polymorphic way</em>, meaning that it’s implemented in a uniform way to handle <em>any</em> <code>i</code>, <code>hs</code>, or <code>o</code> the caller could possibly ask for. (Provided that they satisfy the typeclass constraints, of course)</p>
<p>We have some other functions we defined in the last part, as well, that are defined in such a parametrically polymorphic way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">runNet ::</span> forall i hs o<span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="dt">KnownNat</span> i, <span class="dt">KnownNat</span> o)
       <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">R</span> i
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">R</span> o

<span class="ot">train  ::</span> forall i hs o<span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="dt">KnownNat</span> i, <span class="dt">KnownNat</span> o)
       <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">R</span> i
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">R</span> o
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o
       <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o</code></pre></div>
<p><code>runNet</code> is written a way that it can work for <em>any</em> <code>i</code> or <em>any</em> <code>hs</code> or <em>any</em> <code>o</code> you want or need (provided they satisfy the typeclass constraints). It takes a <code>Network i hs o</code> for any <code>i</code>, <code>hs</code>, or <code>o</code>, and an <code>R i</code> for the same <code>i</code>, and returns an <code>R o</code> for the same <code>o</code>. The way they are implemented does not depend on the specific structure of the network.</p>
<p>Contrast this to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">foo ::</span> <span class="dt">Network</span> <span class="dv">10</span> <span class="ch">&#39;[6,4] 3 -&gt; R 3</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is specifically implemented to <em>only</em> work on networks with 10 inputs, 6 and 4-node hidden layers, and 3 outputs. It <em>does</em> care about the structure of the network you put in.</p>
<p>Now, the concept of “types that depend on run-time” seems to jive with this concept. If we want to write functions that work on types that depend on run-time, it would make sense that they have to be able to anticipate and work for <em>any</em> type that the run-time processes might demand.</p>
<p>And that’s sort of the secret to working with “types that depend on run-time” in Haskell — you have to deal with them in a way that adapts to any type that can come at you!</p>
<h3 id="reification">Reification</h3>
<p>So we know that <code>randomNet</code> is such a function that works with <em>any</em> <code>hs</code> you could possibly throw at it. The last missing piece is a function can <em>run</em> <code>randomNet</code> with an <code>hs</code> that depends on run-time factors.</p>
<p>Enter <code>withSomeSing</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">withSomeSing
<span class="ot">    ::</span> [<span class="dt">Integer</span>]
    <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (forall hs<span class="fu">.</span> <span class="dt">Sing</span> (<span class="ot">hs ::</span> [<span class="dt">Nat</span>]) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> r)
    <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> r</code></pre></div>
<p>(I’ve specialized it there to work with <code>[Integer]</code> and <code>[Nat]</code>, but it works in general with any singleton and the values it represents)</p>
<p>The type signature says “Give me an <code>[Integer]</code> and a function that is ready to take <em>any</em> <code>hs</code>, and I’ll run it with the <code>hs</code> from the <code>[Integer]</code> for you”.</p>
<p>For example, if we had <code>foo :: Sing hs -&gt; Int</code>, and we pass it to <code>withSomeSing [1,2,3]</code>, it’ll <em>run</em> <code>foo</code>, setting with <code>hs</code> to be <code>'[1,2,3]</code>.</p>
<p>We can re-write <code>randomNet</code> to take a <code>Sing hs -&gt;</code> instead of a <code>SingI hs =&gt;</code> (remember, the two are just two ways of writing the same thing. Re-read the <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html#singletons-and-induction">singletons section</a> for a review!) to make things more clear:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="co">-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs#L47-50</span>

           <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Sing</span> hs <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m (<span class="dt">Network</span> i hs o)
randomNet&#39; <span class="fu">=</span> \<span class="kw">case</span> <span class="dt">SNil</span>            <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>     <span class="dt">O</span> <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> randomWeights
                   <span class="dt">SNat</span> <span class="ot">`SCons`</span> ss <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (<span class="fu">:&amp;~</span>) <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> randomWeights <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> randomNet&#39; ss</code></pre></div>
<p>And we can implement the concept we had before:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="co">-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs#L149-156</span>

      print net
      <span class="co">-- blah blah stuff with our dynamically generated net</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>someSing xs :: (forall hs. Sing hs -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code> is a function that’s waiting for a <code>Sing hs -&gt; r</code> that works for <em>any</em> <code>hs</code>. It’ll “run” the function with the <code>hs</code> corresponding to <code>xs :: [Integer]</code>.</p>
<p>In our case, we gave it a function <code>forall hs. Sing hs -&gt; IO ()</code>, and it <em>runs</em> that function <em>with</em> the <code>hs</code> corresponding to list we give it.</p>
<p>So, if we gave <code>withSomeSing</code> the list <code>[6,3]</code>, I’ll <em>run</em> our action as if it had <code>hs ~ '[6,3]</code>. And remember — because our function is parametrically polymorphic to work with any <code>hs</code>, it’ll happily accept it!</p>
<!-- It's conceivable that you might be able to have the input and output sizes -->
<!-- known at compile-time, but it's probably likely that you *don't* know the what -->
<!-- you want your hidden layer structure to be in advance.  You might want to load -->
<!-- it from a configuration file, or have it depend on user input.  But can a type -->
<!-- really depend on things that you can't know until runtime? -->
<!-- Having the entire structure of your neural network in the type is nice and -->
<!-- all for cool tricks like `randomNet`...but do you *really* want to work with -->
<!-- this directly?  After all, from the user's perspective, the user really only -->
<!-- ever needs to know `i` and `o`: What vectors the network *expects*, and what -->
<!-- vectors the network *outputs*.  In the end, all a (feed-forward) Neural Network -->
<!-- really is is an abstraction over a function `R i -> R o`. -->
<!-- Remember, the main benefits of having the entire structure in the type was to -->
<!-- help us *implement* our functions more safely, with the compiler's help, and -->
<!-- also for cute return type polymorphism tricks like `randomNet` and `getNet`. -->
<!-- The *first* type of benefit really doesn't benefit the *user* of the network. -->
<!-- So let's talk about a way to "abstract" away the internal structure of hidden -->
<!-- nodes from the type, and maybe even have it depend on runtime values! -->
<!-- Serializing Networks -->
<!-- -------------------- -->
<!-- Just to warm up, let's talk about serializing networks: writing them to binary -->
<!-- and re-reading them. -->
<!-- ### Recap on the Binary Library -->
<!-- Serializing networks of *known* size --- whose sizes are statically in their -->
<!-- types --- is pretty straightforward.  I'm going to be using the *[binary][]* -->
<!-- library, which offers a very standard typeclass-based approach for serializing and -->
<!-- deserializing data.  There are a lot of tutorials online (and I even [wrote a small -->
<!-- one][huffman] myself a few years ago), but a very high-level view is that the -->
<!-- library offers a typeclass for describing serialization schemes for different -->
<!-- types. -->
<!-- [binary]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/binary -->
<!-- [huffman]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/streaming-huffman-compression-in-haskell-part-2-binary.html -->
<!-- For example, for serializing lists, you have: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- putList :: Binary a => [a] -> Put -->
<!-- putList []     = -->
<!--     put False           -- signal the end -->
<!-- putList (x:xs) = do -->
<!--     put True            -- signal a cons -->
<!--     put x -->
<!--     putList xs -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Where `put :: Binary a => a -> Put` is a polymorphic way of describing -->
<!-- serialization of things with a `Binary` instance --- every type provides its -->
<!-- own `put`.  Sequencing `Put`s using do notation is saying "put this, then -->
<!-- that, then that". -->
<!-- We can deserialize by describing a monadic `Get` plan: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- getList :: Binary a => Get [a] -->
<!-- getList = do -->
<!--     isCons <- get -->
<!--     if isCons -->
<!--       then do -->
<!--         x  <- get -->
<!--         xs <- getList -->
<!--         return (x:xs) -->
<!--       else -->
<!--         return [] -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- And `get :: Binary a => Get a` is a polymorphic way of describing a strategy of -->
<!-- deserializing things with a `Binary` instance --- again, every type provides -->
<!-- its own `get`.  Sequencing `Get`s is again simply "do-this-then-that". -->
<!-- We can write our own instances for our own types by providing `put` and `get` -->
<!-- together: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- instance Binary a => Binary [a] where -->
<!--     put = putList -->
<!--     get = getList -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- In practice, we usually don't write our own instances from scratch.  Instead, -->
<!-- we use GHC's generics features to give us instances for free: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "data Weights" "instance (KnownNat i, KnownNat o) => Binary (Weights i o)" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- For simple types like `Weights`, which simply "contain" serializable things, -->
<!-- the *binary* library is smart enough to write your instances automatically for -->
<!-- you! -->
<!-- ### `Binary` for `Network` -->
<!-- Writing `putNet` and `getNet` to put/get `Network`s is pretty nice because the -->
<!-- entire structure is already known ahead of time, and we don't need to do any -->
<!-- tricks with flags like for lists. -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "putNet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Even simpler than for lists!  If it's an `O w`, just serialize the `w`.  If -->
<!-- it's a `w :&~ net`, serialize the `w` then the rest of the `net`.  The reason -->
<!-- we can get away without any flags is because we already *know* how many `:&~` -->
<!-- layers to expect *just from the type*.  If we want to deserialize/load a -->
<!-- `Network 5 '[10,6,3] 2`, we *know* we want three `(:&~)`'s and one `O` --- no -->
<!-- need for dynamically sized networks like we had to handle for lists. -->
<!-- We'll write `getNet` similarly to how wrote [`randomNet`][randomNet] from the -->
<!-- last post: -->
<!-- !!![randomNet]:dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped.hs "randomNet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "getNet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- To deserialize a `Network i hs o`, we have to "pattern match" on `hs` to see -->
<!-- what constructor we are expecting to deserialize.  We use singletons (with -->
<!-- constructors we *can* literally pattern match on) to tell GHC what types we are -->
<!-- handling, in a process called "dependent pattern matching". -->
<!-- If you see a `SNil :: Sing '[]`, that means that `hs` is `'[]`, so expect a `O` -->
<!-- constructor.  If you see `SCons s ss :: Sing (h ': hs)`, that means that `hs` -->
<!-- is `h ': h'`, so expect a `(:&~)` constructor.  (If this is a little confusing -->
<!-- still, try re-reading the [singleton section][new-section] from the last post -->
<!-- again for a more thorough description!) -->
<!-- Note that here we decide to implement `getNet` by asking for an explicit -->
<!-- singleton input (`Sing hs ->`) instead of an implicit one (`SingI hs =>`) like -->
<!-- we did for `randomNet`.  Remember that the two methods are technically -->
<!-- equivalent, really, and compile to the same thing at runtime.  Because of type -->
<!-- erasure in Haskell, we need one or the other, at least.  We either pass in -->
<!-- `Sing hs`, or provide a `SingI hs` constraint so that we can use `sing :: Sing -->
<!-- hs` to construct the `Sing hs`. -->
<!-- There's a trade-off either way, and it can be a bit annoying because switching -->
<!-- between different modes can potentially be diverse.  For the most part, always -->
<!-- try to *take explicit singleton arguments* where you can, especially for -->
<!-- internal functions.  The simple reason is because in Haskell, we like to really -->
<!-- only do typeclass-level programming as a last, last resort.  Typeclasses in -->
<!-- Haskell are very magical, but normal values (like singletons) *are* first-class -->
<!-- and easily passed and manipulable. -->
<!-- Explicit singleton arguments can sometimes pose a burden for the caller, -->
<!-- though, so my personal approach is to always use explicit `Sing a` whenever -->
<!-- possible for *internal functions*, and to expose a `SingI a =>` interface for -->
<!-- *user-facing functions* (including for typeclass instances) -->
<!-- Let's write our `Binary` instance for `Network`.  Of course, we can't have -->
<!-- `put` or `get` take a `Sing hs` (that'd change the arity/type of the function), -->
<!-- so what we can do is have their `Binary` instances require a `SingI hs` -->
<!-- constraint, essentially doing the same thing: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "instance (KnownNat i, SingI hs, KnownNat o) => Binary (Network i hs o) where" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- To go from "`SingI` style" to "`Sing` style", we use `sing` to generate the -->
<!-- explicit `Sing hs` from `SingI hs =>`. -->
<!-- Existential Crisis -->
<!-- ------------------ -->
<!-- Now, having the entire structure of your neural network in the type is nice and -->
<!-- all for cool tricks like `randomNet`...but do you *really* want to work with -->
<!-- this directly?  After all, from the user's perspective, the user really only -->
<!-- ever needs to know `i` and `o`: What vectors the network *expects*, and what -->
<!-- vectors the network *outputs*.  In the end, all a (feed-forward) Neural Network -->
<!-- really is is an abstraction over a function `R i -> R o`. -->
<!-- Remember, the main benefits of having the entire structure in the type was to -->
<!-- help us *implement* our functions more safely, with the compiler's help, and -->
<!-- also for cute return type polymorphism tricks like `randomNet` and `getNet`. -->
<!-- The *first* type of benefit really doesn't benefit the *user* of the network. -->
<!-- So let's talk about a way to "abstract" away the internal structure of hidden -->
<!-- nodes from the type, and maybe even have it depend on runtime values! -->
<!-- The big key to "hiding" parts of types and letting them depend on runtime -->
<!-- values is called the *existential type*.  Existential types are sort of the -->
<!-- "opposite" of the normal polymorphic (universally quantified) types you -->
<!-- normally see in Haskell. -->
<!-- For a function like -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- `a` and `b` are universally quantified, which means that the person who *uses* -->
<!-- `map` gets to *decide* what `a` and `b` are.  To be more explicit, that type -->
<!-- signature can be written as: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- For a universally quantified type, the *caller* gets to decide what is -->
<!-- what...and the function has to *adapt* to handle it. -->
<!-- For the *existentially* quantified type, the *function* gets to decide what is -->
<!-- what, and the *caller* has to adapt to handle it. -->
<!-- There are two main ways to work with existential types in Haskell, and we'll -->
<!-- go over both of them now and talk about their relative strengths and weaknesses -->
<!-- and what situations to use either of them in.  It pays to be aware of both! -->
<!-- ### Existential Data Type -->
<!-- Arguably the more natural way in Haskell to work with existential types is to -->
<!-- wrap them in a data type: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "data OpaqueNet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- So, if you have `net :: Network 6 '[10,6,3] 2`, you can create -->
<!-- `ONet sing net :: OpaqueNet 6 2`.  When you use the `ONet` constructor, the -->
<!-- structure of the hidden layers disappears from the type! -->
<!-- How do we use this type?  When we *pattern match* on `ONet`, we get the -->
<!-- singleton and the net back! -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "numHiddens ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Note that it's important for us to stuff in the singleton in addition to the -->
<!-- network itself, because of type erasure.  If we didn't pop the singleton in, -->
<!-- there'd be no way for us to recover the original `hs`!  (Note that we could -->
<!-- have had `ONet :: SingI hs => Network i hs o -> OpaqueNet i o`, which is -->
<!-- essentially the same thing) -->
<!-- Once you *do* pattern match on `ONet`, you have to handle the `hs` in a -->
<!-- *completely polymorphic way*.  You're not allowed to assume anything about -->
<!-- `hs`...you have to provide a completely parametrically polymorphic way of -->
<!-- dealing with it! -->
<!-- Note that this function is completely not ok: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- bad :: OpaqueNet i o -> Network i hs o -->
<!-- bad = \case ONet _ n -> n -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Why not?  Because a type signature like `OpaqueNet i o -> Network i hs o` -->
<!-- means that the *caller* can decide what `hs` can be --- just like `read :: Read -->
<!-- a => String -> a`, where the caller decides what `a` is. -->
<!-- Of course, this *isn't* the case with the way we've written the function...the -->
<!-- function only returns a *specific* `hs` that the *function* decides.  The -->
<!-- *caller* has to accommodate whatever is inside `ONet`. -->
<!-- #### Binary -->
<!-- Now, let's find out a way to serialize this type!  Now, the structure of our -->
<!-- network is *not* known in the type, so we do have to plant flags in our data -->
<!-- somehow.  We need to store a witness to the structure of the network, as well. -->
<!-- To do this, we can move `hs` from the type level to the value level.  In -->
<!-- Haskell, this is called **reflection**.  The *singletons* library provides the -->
<!-- `fromSing` function for this purpose: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- ghci> fromSing (sing :: Sing '[1,2,3]) -->
<!-- [1,2,3] -->
<!-- ghci> fromSing (sing :: Sing '[True, False]) -->
<!-- [True, False] -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- And with that, we can write a serializer for `OpaqueNet`: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "putONet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Put the structure (as a flag), and then put the network itself. -->
<!-- Now, to deserialize, we want to *load* the list of `Integer`s and move that -->
<!-- *back* into the type level.  In Haskell, this is called **reification**, the -->
<!-- dual of reflection. -->
<!-- The *singletons* library provides the `toSing` function, which returns a -->
<!-- `SomeSing` (an existentially quantified `Sing` wrapped in a constructor that we -->
<!-- can pattern match on): -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "getONet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- We first `get` the `[Integer]`, then *reify* the list of integers into the type -->
<!-- level by getting our `ss :: Sing hs`.  Then we `getNet ss`, remembering that -->
<!-- `getNet` takes a singleton to figure out what structure to get.  Then we wrap -->
<!-- it all up in the `ONet` constructor. -->
<!-- Phew!  We load our flag, reify it, and once we're back in the typed land again, -->
<!-- we can do our normal business! -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "instance (KnownNat i, KnownNat o) => Binary (OpaqueNet i o)" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- #### The Boundary -->
<!-- Did you notice what we just did there?  The *type* of `Sing hs` was -->
<!-- *dynamically generated* based on the *value* of the `[Integer]` we load at -->
<!-- runtime.  We just worked with types that *depended* on runtime values. -->
<!-- With the power of existentially quantified types (like in `SomeSing`), we -->
<!-- essentially gained the ability to work with types that depend on runtime -->
<!-- results. -->
<!-- In a way, you can consider the `toSing` and the `SomeSing` as our "boundary" -->
<!-- between the "untyped world" and the "typed world".  This layer (and the process -->
<!-- of reification) cleanly separates the two. -->
<!-- This "boundary" can be thought of as a lot like the boundary we talk about -->
<!-- between "pure" functions and values and "impure" (IO, etc.) ones.  We say to -->
<!-- always write as much of your program as possible in the "pure" world, and -->
<!-- to separate and pull out as much logic as you can to be pure logic.  That's -->
<!-- sort of one of the first things you learn about as a Haskell programmer: how -->
<!-- to separate logic that *can* be pure from logic that is "impure" (IO, etc.), -->
<!-- and then "combine them" at the very end, as late as possible. -->
<!-- Well, if the final program is going to be IO in the end anyway, why bother -->
<!-- separating out pure and impure parts of your logic?  Separation of concerns, -->
<!-- the increased ability to reason with your code and analyze what it does, the -->
<!-- compiler's ability to check what you write, the limitation of implementations, -->
<!-- and etc. are all reasons any Haskeller should be familiar with reciting. -->
<!-- You can think of the general philosophy of working with typed/untyped worlds as -->
<!-- being the same thing.  You can write as much of your program as possible in the -->
<!-- "typed" world, like we did in Part 1.  Take advantage of the increased ability -->
<!-- to reason with your code, parametric polymorphism helping you *write* your -->
<!-- code, limit your implementations, nab you compiler help, etc.  All of those are -->
<!-- benefits of working in the typed world. -->
<!-- Then, write what you must in your "untyped" world, such as dealing with values -->
<!-- that pop up at runtime like the `[Integer]` above. -->
<!-- Finally, at the end, *unite* them at the boundary.  Pass the control football -->
<!-- from the untyped world to the typed world! -->
<!-- #### Reifying for Fun and Profit -->
<!-- Before we move on, let's see a more direct example of reification: creating -->
<!-- networks with variable internal structure based on runtime input, like -->
<!-- configuration files. -->
<!-- Maybe you're reading the internal size from a configuration file, or maybe you -->
<!-- want it to be determined by user input.  Our old `randomNet` won't work: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- randomNet :: (MonadRandom m, SingI hs) -->
<!--           => m (Network i hs o) -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Because we need a static type signature to use it directly.  But we can return -->
<!-- an `OpaqueNet`! -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "randomONet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Note that the implementation is slightly awkward because we had the lack of -->
<!-- foresight to implement `randomNet` using `SingI hs =>` instead of `Sing hs ->`, -->
<!-- so we have to "go from `Sing` to `SingI`". -->
<!-- You go from the `SingI` style to the `Sing` style with `sing`, like we saw -->
<!-- earlier, and you can go backwards with `singInstance`: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- singInstance :: Sing a -> SingInstance a -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Where the data type `SingInstance` has a single constructor that's a lot like -->
<!-- `SNat` from the last part: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- data SingInstance a where -->
<!--     SingInstance :: SingI a => SingInstance a -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Basically, it's impossible to *use* the `SingInstance` constructor unless you -->
<!-- have a `SingI a` instance in scope, so if you ever *pattern match* on it, it's -->
<!-- a "proof" that `SingI a` exists.  It's the same as how, for the constructor -->
<!-- `SNat :: KnownNat n => Sing n`, if you pattern match on `SNat` and see that -->
<!-- it's not something silly like `undefined`/`error`/bottom, GHC knows that there -->
<!-- is a `KnownNat n` instance.  It's sort of like pattern matching out the -->
<!-- instance itself. -->
<!-- Now you can get from your untyped world into the world of dependent types --- -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "main ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- ### Continuation-Based Existentials -->
<!-- There's another way in Haskell that we work with existential types that can be -->
<!-- more natural and easy to work with in a lot of cases. -->
<!-- Note that when we pattern match on an existential data type, you have to work -->
<!-- with the values in the constructor in a parametrically polymorphic way.  For -->
<!-- example, if we had: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- oNetToFoo :: OpaqueNet i o -> Foo -->
<!-- oNetToFoo = \case ONet s n -> f s n -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- What does the type of `f` have to be?  It has to take a `Sing hs` and a -->
<!-- `Network i hs o`, but deal with it in a way that works *for all* `hs`.  It has -->
<!-- to be: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- f :: forall (hs :: [Nat]). Sing hs -> Network i hs o -> Foo -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- That is, it can't be written for *only* `Sing '[5]` or *only* `Sing -->
<!-- '[6,3]`...it has to work for *any* `hs`. -->
<!-- Well, we could really also just skip the data type together and represent an -->
<!-- existential type as something *taking* the continuation `f` and giving it what -->
<!-- it needs. -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "type OpaqueNet'" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- "Tell me how you would make an `r` if you had a `Sing hs` and a `Network i hs -->
<!-- o`, and I'll make it for you!" -->
<!-- This "continuation transformation" is known as formally -->
<!-- **skolemization**.[^skolemization]  We can "wrap" a `Network i hs o` into an -->
<!-- `OpaqueNet' i o r` pretty straightforwardly: -->
<!-- [^skolemization]: Skolemization is probably one of the coolest words you'll -->
<!-- encounter working with dependent types in Haskell, and sometimes just knowing -->
<!-- that you're "skolemizing" something makes you feel cooler.  Thank you [Thoralf -->
<!-- Skolem][].  If you ever see a "rigid, skolem" error in GHC, you can thank him -->
<!-- for that too! -->
<!-- [Thoralf Skolem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "oNet' ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- To prove that the two `OpaqueNet`s are the same (and to help us see more about -->
<!-- how they relate), we can write functions that convert back and forth from them: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "withONet ::" "toONet ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Note the expanded type signature of `withONet`, which you can sort of interpret -->
<!-- as, "do *this function* on the existentially quantified contents of an -->
<!-- `OpaqueNet`." -->
<!-- #### Trying it out -->
<!-- To sort of compare how the two methods look like in practice, we're going to -->
<!-- Rosetta stone it up and re-implement serialization with the continuation-based -->
<!-- existentials: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "putONet' ::" "getONet' ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- To be cute, I used the skolemized partners of `toSing` and `SomeSing`: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- withSomeSing :: [Integer] -->
<!--              -> (forall (hs :: [Nat]). Sing hs -> r) -->
<!--              -> r -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Instead of returning a `SomeSing` like `toSing` does, `withSomeSing` returns -->
<!-- the continuation-based existential. -->
<!-- The expanded type signature of `getONet'` can be read: "Give what you would do -->
<!-- if you *had* a `Sing hs` and a `Network i hs o`", and I'll get them for you and -->
<!-- give you the result." -->
<!-- Let's also see how we'd return a random network with a continuation: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "withRandomONet' :" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- Again, to be cute, I used the continuation-based version of `singInstance`, -->
<!-- `withSingI`: -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- withSingI :: Sing a -> (SingI a => r) -> r -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- The signature, in English, is "give me a `Sing a` and a value that you could -->
<!-- make *if only you had* a `SingI` instance, and I'll give you that value as if -->
<!-- you had the instance, magically!" -->
<!-- Of course, we know it's not magic:[^magic] -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- withSingI :: Sing a -> (SingI a => r) -> r -->
<!-- withSingI s x = case singInstance s of -->
<!--                   SingInstance -> x -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
<!-- [^magic]: Actually, it kind of *is* magic, because `singInstance` is implemented -->
<!-- with `unsafeCoerce`.  But don't tell anyone ;) -->
<!-- And we see another way we can "move past the untyped/typed boundary": -->
<!-- ~~~haskell -->
<!-- !!!dependent-haskell/NetworkTyped2.hs "main' ::" -->
<!-- ~~~ -->
